What is Blockonomics?
-------------------------

`Blockonomics <https://www/blockonomics.co>`_ is a web based bitcoin tracker.
Its wallet watcher can be used to see history of your bitcoin transactions,
get email notfications of payments and know your total balance. You can also create encrypted invoices, receive payments directly into your TREZOR
wallet without the need of opening your wallet.    

Blockonomics requires your
TREZOR wallet XPUB to be able to perform these functions.
It cannot create transactions or send your bitcoins, it is only  a **wallet watcher**.
